# Forum Manifesto

Be friendly and have fun.

Fun, because programming is exhausting. Programming is constantly changing so the learning never ends. This show and forum is here to help you stay curious about programming so that you can fall in love with it over and over again.

Friendly, because programming is confusing, and sometimes we feel stupid and alone, because everyone around us seems so smart. The show, and this forum is here to constantly remind you that in reality all of us are confused, and that is fine. That feeling of confusion is our friend, it means weâ€™re learning.

Share your confusion. Post that dumb question. Other people are just as confused but are too afraid to ask.

Share your excitement. When you find a piece of code or anything that just makes you happy to be a programmer, post that!

We do not tolerate harassment of forum participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

# The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in harassing behavior, the moderators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or banning from the forum with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a moderator or staff member.

We value the presence and contributions of all forum members and are here to help if needed. We expect members to follow these rules at all times
