# Forum Manifesto

Be friendly and have fun.

Fun, because programming is exhausting. Programming is constantly changing so the learning never ends. This show and forum is here to help you stay curious about programming so that you can fall in love with it over and over again.

Friendly, because programming is confusing, and sometimes we feel stupid and alone, because everyone around us seems so smart. The show, and this forum is here to constantly remind you that in reality all of us are confused, and that is fine. That feeling of confusion is our friend, it means weâ€™re learning.

Share your confusion. Post that dumb question. Other people are just as confused but are too afraid to ask.

Share your excitement. When you find a piece of code or anything that just makes you happy to be a programmer, post that!

# Forum Code of Conduct

All members of FunFunForum are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Staff/moderators will enforce this code. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe community for everybody.

## The Quick Version

Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

We welcome discussion and debate around technology, programming approaches, language choices, software architecture and related topics but expect that conversation will remain respectful at all times. 

Discrimination based on level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity or religion (or lack thereof) will not be tolerated. We do not tolerate harassment of forum participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate. Forum participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or removed from the forum without a refund at the discretion of the moderators and final say of staff.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive comments related to technology choices, level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a member engages in harassing behaviour, the moderators may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or banning from the forum with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a moderator or staff member.

We value the presence and contributions of all forum members and are here to help if needed. We expect members to follow these rules at all times
